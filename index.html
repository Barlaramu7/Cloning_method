    <p>Python Full Stack Development covers both frontend and backend web development.

        The backend is built using Python frameworks like Django or Flask.
        
        Frontend development involves HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Vue.js.
        
        Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB store and manage data.
        
        APIs are used to connect the frontend and backend for data exchange.
        
        Developers handle authentication, business logic, and server-side operations.
        
        Deployment tools like Docker, AWS, or Heroku help host applications.
        
        Full Stack Developers need to understand version control tools like Git.
        
        Debugging and testing ensure smooth application performance.
        
        Mastering both frontend and backend technologies enables building complete web applications.</p>
